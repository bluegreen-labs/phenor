\usage{
rmse(par, data, model, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{par}{a vector of parameter values, this is functions specific}

\item{data}{nested data structure with validation data as returned
by format_phenocam() or format_pep725(), or your own dataset adhering
to the same data structure.}

\item{model}{the model name to be used in optimizing the model
Most models are listed in Melaas et al. 2013, additional ones
will be added over time, preliminary list:
1. SEQ1.3}

\item{...}{extra arguments to pass to the function}

the RMSE comparing observed and estimated values
